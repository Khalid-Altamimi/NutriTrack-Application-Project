# NutriTrack-Application-Project

As a user, I want to sign up and log in so that I can have a secure account to store my nutrition data.
As a user, I want to create meals with a name, type (breakfast, lunch, dinner, snack), and calories so that I can track what I eat every day.
As a user, I want to view all my meals so that I can see what I have eaten and my daily calorie total.
As a user, I want to update my meals so that I can fix mistakes or adjust calorie information.
As a user, I want to delete meals so that I can remove incorrect or unwanted entries from my record.

NutriTrack is a meal and calorie tracking web application that allows users to log, edit, and manage their daily meals while reviewing their nutrition history. I created NutriTrack as a practical project to combine what I've learned about full-stack development, Especially focusing on CRUD functionality. The idea behind the app is to make it easier for people to stay mindful of their eating habits and promote healthier lifestyles.
